# CheeseHacks Repo

This repo contains the final version of the facial-recognition-based attendance system that won the Fall '22 CheeseHacks hackathon at UW-Madison. It was a huge honor to be selected as first place out of the 30+ teams that entered! I was lucky enough to work with a team of 3 other great computer science students, Yogesh, DJ, and Sameer.

Given that the hackathon started at noon on Saturday and ended Sunday morning, the code is quite messy! If you have any questions about the project, our design choices, or facial recognition in general, please check out the paper or slides in the CV771-Report repo.
