# Face Attendance

This project represents my first exploration of an attendance system based on facial recognition. This app lets users upload images from their local computer and stores those images on the file system of the server based on the class code for the given student. This is a crucial first step towards a simple system for attendance based on facial recognition like the one my team implemented in the CheeseHacks hackathon. 

The project served as my first foray into using the Flask library, so it was a great learning experience.
